# ERAg
The ERAg R-package contains the ERA dataset ```ERAg::ERA.Compiled```, bibliography ```ERAg::ERA_Bibliography```, search strings ```ERAg::ERA_Search_Terms```, meta-data ```ERAg::ERACompiledFields``` and codes ```ERAg::PracticeCodes``` ```ERAg::OutcomeCodes``` ```ERAg::EUCodes```, plus data processing and analysis functions. Please use ```browseVignettes("ERAg")``` for vignettes that will guide you through the contents of this package. ERAg is complimented by the [ERAgON package](https://github.com/EiA2030/ERAgON) which links ERA observations to climate, soils and topographical information.

Information on the effects of changing agricultural management on crop and livestock performance is critical
for developing evidence-based policies, investments, and programs. Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA) 
 presents a dataset that harmonizes and aggregates >100k observations from >2k agricultural studies taken 
 place in Africa. The dataset includes information on the effect of 364 combinations of management practices
 and technologies on 87 environmental, social, and economic indicators of outcomes. Observations are 
 geolocated and temporally tagged and thus can be linked to other datasets such as historical weather, soil
 properties, and road networks. ERA offers a new resource for understanding the impacts of changing farming 
 practices under diverse environmental contexts, providing data to support strategic interventions aimed to 
 enhance productivity, resilience, and sustainability of African agriculture.
