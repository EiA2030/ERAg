\description{
The \code{CalcClimate} function applies a complex sequence of calculations to site level climate data extracted for ERA observations.
The \code{ERA-Climate-Data} vignette describes how to construct the datasets that need to be supplied to  \code{CalcClimate}, at this time the vignette is outdated but revision is planned.
\code{CalcClimate} calculates seasonal and long-term average climate variables. The deviance of seasonal values from  long-term averages is also calculated. \code{CalcClimate} can also
provide bioclimatic variables annually with long-term averages and annual deviance (argument \code{Do.BioClim=T}). The \code{Observed} data.table returned in the output list shows calculated
climate variables (such as growing degree days, total rainfall and dry-spells) using the ERA dataset provided and temporal windows of calculation defined using the
\code{Win.Start} and \code{Windows} arguments. Two calculations windows are defined by default: \code{Data} which uses the planting and harvest dates reported/estimated and \code{EcoCrop}
which uses the planting dates reported/estimated and EcoCrop estimates of season length. Additional windows of analysis (e.g. post planting 1-30 days after planting) can
are defined using the \code{Windows} argument. If argument \code{Do.LT.Avg=T}estimates of long-term climate are estimated using planting dates derived from the rainfall data supplied (and not the ERA data, unless
insufficient rainfall to estimate a planting date) and the arguments \code{Rain.Windows}, \code{Widths}, \code{Rain.Threshold} and \code{LongTerm}. The end years of the period for which
long-term averages are calculated is set using the \code{Max.LT.Avg} argument. Please carefully read the \strong{Details} and \strong{Arguments} section of this documentation before use.

\details{
Process:
\enumerate{
\item Season Length \code{SLen} is calculated as difference between mean planting and harvest dates.
\item The \code{SLen} function is applied to the data which combines accurate temporal planting/harvest data with estimates using the following and sequential logic:
i) where \code{(Plant.End-Plant.Start)>20}and a planting date derived from the \code{EstPDayRain} function is available \code{SLen} is substituted for
\code{Harvest.End} - rainfall estimate planting date;
ii) where \code{(Plant.End-Plant.Start<20) & (Harvest.End-Harvest.Start>=20)} \code{SLen} is substituted for \code{Harvest.End-(Plant.Start+(Plant.End-Plant.Start)/2)};
iii) A \code{P.Date.Merge} field is added to \code{DATA} as \code{Plant.Start+(Plant.End-Plant.Start)/2};
iv) Missing \code{NA} values of \code{P.Date.Merge} are substituted with estimates derived from similar nearby observations estimated using the \code{EstPDayData}
function;
v) A \code{SLen.Merge}  field is added to \code{DATA} equivalent to the \code{SLen} field with missing \code{NA} values substituted with estimates derived from similar nearby
observations estimated using the \code{EstSLenData} function;
vi) A \code{SLen.Ecocrop} field is added to \code{DATA} as \code{(cycle_min+cycle_max)/2};
vii) \code{DATA} is subset to data.table named \code{SS} which contains unique values of location, product, observation date and planting/harvest/season length
fields. Some form of planting date and season length estimate must be present;
vii) Where there is a difference of greater than 60\% between ecocrop vs data estimates of season length observations are rejected.
\emph{The use of Harvest.End in Steps i & ii is deliberate; when uncertainty is large using mean planting and harvest dates can result in unrealistically
short season lengths that distort measures of seasonal climate, especially precipitation. The use of Harvest.End may overestimate season length overall for highly uncertain
scenarios, but we consider the effect this on seasonal climate measures less severe.}
\item For each row of \code{SS} the \code{CLIMATE} dataset is filtered on the \code{Date} field for two temporal periods based on the date fields \code{P.Date.Merge} and \code{SLen.Merge}
or \code{SLen.Ecocrop}, note one day is added to \code{P.Date.Merge} so the temporal window begins the day after planting. An additional temporal windows can
be specified using data.table supplied to the \code{Windows} argument, the data.table requires three fields: 1) \code{Name}; 2) \code{Start} and 3) \code{End}. The
\code{Start} and \code{End} fields define the additional temporal period as days after\code{P.Date.Merge}.For example \code{Window=data.table(Name="Plant.1-30",Start=1,End=30)}
is a temporal period from planting to 30 days after planting.
\item For each temporal period specified in multiple climate statistics are calculated:
i) \strong{growing degrees days (GDD)} are calculated using the \code{GDDcalc} function which requires daily \code{Tmax} and \code{Tmin} fields from \code{CLIMATE} and the EcoCrop
optimal and absolute temperate thresholds (fields \code{Tlow}, \code{Topt.low}, \code{Topt.high}, and \code{Thigh}) added to \code{DATA} using the \code{AddEcoCrop} function.
The \code{GDDcalc} function outputs four fields \code{GDDlow}, \code{GDDopt}, \code{GDDhigh} and \code{GDDmax} and the values of these are summed for the temporal period;
ii) \strong{precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ETo)} statistics are estimated using the \code{RAIN.Calc} function which outputs a number of variables
described in the documentation for this function;
iii) \strong{min, max and mean daily temperatures and rainfall plus variance};
iv) Using the \code{Rain.Threshold} and \code{Temp.Threshold} parameters thresholds and their direction (greater or lower) can be specified for rainfall and
minimum and maximum temperatures. Within a temporal period the total number of threshold exceedance days are calculated. The \code{RSeqLen} and \code{TSeqLen}
parameters define sequence lengths (e.g. 5 days), for each value of these parameters the number of sequences of consecutive days in exceedance of rainfall or
temperature thresholds equal to higher than the specified sequence length are summed. If the rainfall threshold is \code{1} with direction \code{lower} and \code{RSeqLen}
is 5, then the number of sequences of consecutive days with less than 1mm rainfall of sequence length 5 days or more are counted. Note in the previous
scenario a sequence of length 30 days would only count as one sequence;
v) Similar to iv), the number of days and sequences of days (\code{ERSeqLen}) with \code{Eratio} less than the thresholds set in \code{ER.Threshold} are calculated. Mean, median and minimum \code{ERatio} values are also calculated; and
vi) Similar to iv), the number of days and sequences of days (\code{LSeqLen}) where \code{Logging} exceeds \code{0}, \code{0.5*ssat} or \code{ssat} are calculated. Summed, mean, median and maximum \code{Logging} values are also calculated
\item If argument \code{Do.LT.Avg==T} annual and long-term climate statistics an planting dates are calculated  for each combination of location and product. Note
that each season in the data is treated separately. The process logic is as follows:
i) The median planting julian day of the year is taken for the location x product combination;
ii) For each year of complete climate data, the median planting date from i) is used as a starting point to estimate planting date from rainfall using the
\code{Est.Rain} function which takes the arguments \code{Rain.Windows}, \code{Widths} and \code{Rain.Threshold} as explained in the arguments for this function. These data are
returned as \verb{[[LongTerm]][[LT.PD.Years]]};
iii) Estimated planting dates from ii) are averaged (mean, sd, median) across years and returned as \verb{[[LongTerm]][[LT.PD.Avg]]};
iv) Annual planting date deviance is calculated as the absolute difference between the annual and mean/median planting dates and appended to
the output of ii);
v) Annual climate statistics are calculated for each year x site x product combination using the rainfall estimated planting date and as per steps
3 & 4. Data are return as \verb{[[LongTerm]][[LT.Clim.Years]]}. Where insufficient rainfall fell to meet the thresholds specified in ii) then the a median
planting date is substituted from those years that did have sufficient rainfall in ii);
vi) Long-term climate statistics from v) are calculated across years for mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum statistics. Data are
returned \verb{[[LongTerm]][[LT.Clim.Avg]]}; and
vii) Deviance from long-term mean and median values for each climate statistic is appended as columns to the output of v).
\item If argument \code{Do.BioClim==T} then:
i) Annual bioclimatic values are calculated using the \link[dismo]{biovars} function for each complete year of
data in \code{CLIMATE} per unique locationas (\code{ID} field) in \code{DATA}. The output data is return as [\link{Annual.BioClim}][\link{Annual.Estimates}]\verb{;   ii) Bioclim variables are averaged over time to give long-term mean and median values. The output data is return as [[Annual.BioClim]][[LT.Averages]]}; and
iii) Deviance from long-term mean and median values for each climate statistic is appended as columns to the output of i).

If you are finding there are observations with suspiciously short reported season lengths in the ERA dataset (i.e. errors in the reporting of
planting and/or harvest dates) you can exclude observations (\code{Exclude.EC.Diff}) where the absolute difference between reported and EcoCrop estimated season lengths
is greater than a specified proportion (\code{EC.Diff}).
