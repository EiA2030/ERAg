\title{Remove Extreme Outliers}
\usage{
OutCalc(Vals)
}
\arguments{
\item{Vals}{A vector of numeric values.}
}
\value{
A logical vector where \code{TRUE} indicate input values that are extreme outliers.
}
\description{
This simple function will detect extreme outliers (values above or below 3*interquartile range) in a supplied vector of numbers.
}
\details{
Outliers can be problematic in the analysis of ratio data when the control treatment (CT) tends to zero and the experimental treatment (ET) does not
Then the ET/CT ratio tends towards infinity which can unrealistically skew resultsâ€™ distributions. This could occur when there are unequal impacts of
environmental stressors such as drought, heavy rainfall, pest or diseases between CT and ET.
