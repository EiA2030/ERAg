\title{Derive ERA outcomes from existing data}
\usage{
DeriveOutcomes(Data, RmPartial = T, DoWUE = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{An ERA data.table (e.g. \code{ERAg::ERA.Compiled}).}

\item{RmPartial}{Logical \code{T/F}. If \code{T} partial economic outcomes are excluded from the process.}

\item{DoWUE}{Logical \code{T/F}. If \code{T} water use efficiency outcome is derived from yield and TSP (total seasonal precipitation) data}
}
\value{
DeriveOutcomes returns the input \code{data.table} with additional rows appended for derived outcomes.
}
\description{
This function identifies exactly co-located ERA outcomes (same experiment, treatment, location and time) to
generate additional outcomes and appends them to the supplied Data. Note infinite MeanC or MeanT values are removed.
}
\details{
The function currently generates additional outcomes for:
\enumerate{
\item Net Returns (NR) = gross returns (GR) - total costs (TC)
\item Gross Margin (GM) = gross returns (GR) - variable costs (VC)
\item Benefit Cost Ratio (GRTC) =  gross returns (GR)/total costs (TC)
\item Benefit Cost Ratio (GRVC) =  gross returns (GR)/variable costs (VC)
\item Water Use Efficiency (WUE) = yield/total seasonal precipitation
\item Nitrogen Total Factor Productivity (NTFP) = (yield.exp - yield.cont)/N added
}

Derived net returns are appended to \code{Data} before benefit cost ratio outcomes are derived.

Note that many of the outcomes derived from the data can be negative therefore be careful not to exclude these outcomes when applying the \code{ERAg::PrepareERA}
function (the \code{Perc.Neg} parameter could be adjusted to retain negative outcomes).
